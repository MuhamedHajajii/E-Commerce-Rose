# Application Structure

This Angular 19 application follows a modular architecture with the following structure:

```
src/app/
├── core/           # Singleton services and single-use components
├── features/       # Feature modules and components
├── pages/          # Page components and routing modules
├── shared/         # Shared components, directives, and pipes
├── app.routes.ts   # Main routing configuration
├── app.config.ts   # App configuration and providers
└── app.component.ts # Root component
```

## Directory Purposes

- **core/**: Contains application-wide singleton services and components
- **features/**: Contains feature-specific modules and components
- **pages/**: Contains page-level components and their routing modules
- **shared/**: Contains reusable components, directives, and pipes

## Best Practices

1. Keep the app.component.ts minimal
2. Use standalone components by default
3. Implement lazy loading for feature modules
4. Use signals for state management
5. Follow Angular's style guide for naming conventions
6. Implement proper error boundaries
7. Use TypeScript strict mode
8. Implement proper SEO strategies

## Missing Recommendations

1. Add environment configuration
2. Implement state management if needed
3. Add unit and e2e testing configurations
4. Add proper error handling and logging
5. Implement performance monitoring
6. Add proper documentation
7. Implement CI/CD pipelines
